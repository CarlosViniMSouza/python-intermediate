## NumPy Practical Examples: Useful Techniques

The NumPy library is a Python library used for scientific computing. It provides you with a multidimensional array object for storing and analyzing data in a wide variety of ways. In this tutorial, you’ll see examples of some features NumPy provides that aren’t always highlighted in other tutorials. You’ll also get the chance to practice your new skills with various exercises.

**In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to:**

* Create **multidimensional arrays** from data stored in files
* Identify and remove **duplicate data** from a NumPy array
* Use **structured NumPy arrays** to reconcile the differences between datasets
* Analyze and chart specific parts of **hierarchical** data
* Create **vectorized** versions of your own functions
