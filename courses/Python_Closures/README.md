## Python Closures: Common Use Cases and Examples

In Python, a closure is typically a function defined inside another function. This inner function grabs the objects defined in its enclosing scope and associates them with the inner function object itself. The resulting combination is called a closure.

Closures are a common feature in functional programming languages. In Python, closures can be pretty useful because they allow you to create function-based decorators, which are powerful tools.
